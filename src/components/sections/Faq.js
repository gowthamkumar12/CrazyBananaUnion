          <Accordion title="WHAT IS THE METAVERSE?">
            A metaverse is a network of 3D virtual worlds focused on social
            connection. In futurism and science fiction, it is often described
            as a hypothetical iteration of the Internet as a single, universal
            virtual world that is facilitated by the use of virtual and
            augmented reality headsets.

          <Accordion title="WHY DO WE NEED ROYALTIES?">
            The amount of royalties was fixed at 10% to finance the CrazyBananaUnion
            projects. We have the ambition to organize multiple events
            around the world in order to strengthen the community and build a
            network of entrepreneurs and investors with the same mindset and
            common interests.

            exclusive network of investors and entrepreneurs.
